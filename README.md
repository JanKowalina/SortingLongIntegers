# Sorting Large Integers

Sort a given set of large integers with arbitrarily large numbers of digits using the chosen algorithm by the teacher. Your score will be affected if you implement a different algorithm.

## Input

The input consists of the following:

- The number of elements in the input set (N) on the first line.
- N lines containing the numbers to be sorted.

## Output

The output should be a sequence of numbers, each separated by a newline character, in non-descending order.

## Example

### Input

```
8
-1
13
27
328
111
25
1267484339579219017509008125326
-1111111111111111111111111111111111
```

### Output

```
-1111111111111111111111111111111111
-1
13
25
27
111
328
1267484339579219017509008125326
```

Remember to implement the sorting algorithm specified by the teacher to ensure the accuracy of your solution.

## Compilation and Execution

To compile the program, follow these steps:

1. Use a C++ compiler (such as g++) to compile the code:

   ```shell
   g++ -o SortingLongIntegers SortingLongIntegers.cpp
   ```

2. Run the program using the following command:

   ```shell
   ./SortingLongIntegers
   ```

   The program will start running and wait for user input.
